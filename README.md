## Star Officers

Yo yo, my name is **Gwen Chiasson**. I am a second year Interaction Design student at George Brown College.  

Some of my *star* quality skills are:
* Laying on beaches
* Admiring glitter
* Giving really good scratchies to my fur friends
* Listening to the same songs on repeat for weeks on end without getting sick of them
